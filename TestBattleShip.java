/*
Game Launcher class (TestBattleship class)  with main method to instantiate objects from the BattleshipGame class.

Instantiate two objects from the Battleship game.
Use the same rules as you did in the last game with the addition of items from above. Feel free to be creative and add features for extra credit.
Please review the Bingo and the Guessing Game we did in last class to see how you can re-design the game for OOP. You can also check the tic tac toe game for which player plays first.
